## Running and launching
This react-native app was developed + tested using expo on web and an **iOS device**. The auto-generated `app.json` file could be suitable for deploying this app to the app-store but I haven't tested this.

To run locally use `yarn install` then `yarn start`. If you're having trouble check out [create-react-native-app](https://github.com/expo/create-react-native-app) and [expo](https://docs.expo.io/get-started/installation/)

## Preface
This is a project I completed for udacity.com's '[React nano degree](https://d20vrrgs8k4bvw.cloudfront.net/documents/en-US/reactnd-syllabus-3.0.pdf)' program. The idea for this project was provided by udacity.com and I did the rest!

## Note on quality
If any potential employers are looking at this project: please note that I completed this project to the minimal quality standard. I learned what I wanted to learn making this project and didn't spend more time on it than I needed - that leaves more time for other projects!
