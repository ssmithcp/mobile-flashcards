## Running and launching
This react-native app was developed + tested using expo on an **iOS device**. The auto-generated `app.json` file could be suitable for deploying this app to the app-store but I haven't tested this.

To run locally use `yarn install` then `yarn start`. If you're having trouble check out [create-react-native-app](https://github.com/expo/create-react-native-app) and [expo](https://docs.expo.io/get-started/installation/).

# Mobile flash cards!

## Preface
This is a project I completed for udacity.com's '[React nano degree](https://d20vrrgs8k4bvw.cloudfront.net/documents/en-US/reactnd-syllabus-3.0.pdf)' program. The idea for this project was provided by udacity.com and I did the rest!

## Note on quality
If any potential employers are looking at this project: please note that I completed this project to the minimal quality standard. I learned what I wanted to learn making this project and didn't spend more time on it than I needed - that leaves more time for other projects!

## Flash cards?
This app is designed to be a 'study aid'. You can create new decks flash cards, add cards then test your knowledge with a quiz!

## Add a new deck
A 'deck' is a group of related flash cards. For example, you may have a deck of flash cards for math class and one for history. You can add a deck like this:

## Add some questions

## Take a Quiz

## Get reminders to study!
If you do not **complete** a quiz each day, you'll get a reminder to study!

## Areas to improve
The UI/UX leaves lots to be desired. Most of the screens are functional but little/no effort was put into making them look nice. Less time on UI == more time on other projects!
